# Growth and communication

avoid the noise: arguments that have already been settled, hyperbole, chatter from people who don't do much, Brainstorming without clear proposals

Focus on the important stuff: Flaws only you may have notived in a proposal, miscommunication that you can clear up with a clarifying post, saying thank you.

don't admonish people- it doesn't work

## Traps to Avoid

### The Law of Triviality -- the bike-shed effect

- members of an org tend to give disproportionate weight to trivial issues
- it's easier to have an opinion on the easy stuff and to draw consensus

### holy wars

- dispute in which people feel passionately enough about a topic to continue arguing. Not usually resolvable based solely on th merits of the arguments.

- be sympathetic, don't make it personal

### Flaming

- insults, hostility etc. should not be tolerated in a project if you want it to thrive

### Rudeness

- ignoring someones work after promising a respons in advance
- failure to provide quality criticism when reviewing someones work
- it's ok to be blunt

# Roles in OSS projects

There's lots to do, and it's not all coding

## User Experience

- how users interact with a project and how they would like it to function
- it's ok as a new user to make requests and critisisms of a product
- user mailing lists, feature requests

## User Support

- once you have gained some experience of the project, you can support new users who have no experience.
- answer newcomers questions, it's a great way to learn!

## Evangelising and marketing

- Talk about the project, get other people involved!
- check out Google's summer of code

## Software design and implementation

- start off by reporting bugs and submitting fixes.
- do so by submitting  a patch on th issue tracker
- move up to redesigning features or developing current ones
-discuss significant contributions on the developer mailing list before implementation.
-smaller contributins such as bug fixes can be contributed without discussion

## Quality assurance

- testing release candidates and reporting bugs on th issue tracker and helping to manage them until they are fixed
- keep the issue tracker updated, mark duplicates etc,

## Graphic art
