# A Brief History of OSS:

Most software started as OSS b/c the focus was on selling hardware.
Even by the 60s as computers became more common in offices in the 60's it 
was impossible to get a patent for software, and while copyright might be
available, it was nearly impossibe to enforce. Companies like IBM gave
software and updates away for free and encouraged sharing in hopes of
drawing more hardware sales.

in the 70s, As companies started to see software as more valuable, 
they worked to improve software as they saw the value of improving
performance. in 1981, Diamond V. Diehr changed the landscape in a supreme
court ruling in which the patent office was mandated to recognize software
algorithms. following that, companies like Microsoft saw software as a 
valuable product that they needed to keep secret from competitors. this
attitude brought on an era of secrecy and fear as people became afraid of
sharing SW

As companies started to lock their SW assets down, customers had to depend
more upon vendors for bug fixes and feature updates as they could not depend
on Open source communities to provide thsoe fixes due to strict enforcement
of patent law. this lead to some serious liability in the case of critical 
SW systems

BELL LABS, owned by AT&T, was a significant driver of OSS in the early days
of Computers: They pioneered the evolution of Unix. Though Unix started as 
a toy operating system, it became popular at universities and students as 
well as professors contributed to building the operating system. At the time
AT&T was prevented by monopoly rules from exploiting Unix.

Later, in the 1980s, as AT&T was looking for was to expand Revenue, they
noted the growth of Unix and devided to exert control over the system. 
Suddenly, textbooks featuring Unix could not be distributed in the open and
people had to wait for AT&T to provide solutions for issues. Academics who
had contributed to and used Unix for some time started to look for an
alternative.

GNU - GNU's Not Unix, spawned the GPL - GNU's Public License: Freedom to
use, freedom to copy, freedom to modify, and freedom to contribute to the 
software (Stallman). the corporate world resisted; they didn't like the 
word "Free." lol, all hail the corporate overlords. So Bruce Perens and Eri
Raymond worked together to coin the term "open source" and found the open 
source initiative. All free software is open source, but not all open source is free software.

"Free" as in "Puppy"

“Free as in puppy,” a phrase that can be traced back to 2006Links to an 
external site., has emerged as a valuable definition of “free” for modern
open-source projects—one that speaks to the responsibilities of creators
and users to each other and the software, in addition to their rights.
Puppies need food and care to survive; open-source code needs funding and 
“maintainers,” individuals who consistently respond to requests and
feedback from a community, fix bugs, and manage the growth and scope of a
project. Many open-source projects have become too big, complicated, or
important to be governed by one person or even a small group of like-minded
individuals. And open-source contributors have their own needs and concerns,
too. A person who’s good at building may not be good at maintaining;
someone who creates a project may not want to or be able to run it
indefinitely. In 2018, for instance, Guido van Rossum, the creator of the
open-source programming language Python, stepped down from leadershipLinks 
to an external site. after almost 30 years, exhausted from the demands of 
the mostly uncompensated role. “I’m tired,” he wrote in his resignation 
message to the community,  “and need a very long break.”

Richard Stallmean worked in the Artificial intelligence lab at MIT where
Programmers were encouraged and expected to share their improvements, 
otherwise known as the Hacker Ethic. in the 1980s a startup hired many of
the Labs programmers to work on an operating system similar to what they
had been working on at the Lab, only now under an exclusive license and
on equipment now under an exclusive operating system. 

operating systems like VAZ or 68029 made you sign a non-disclosure
agreement before you could get an executable, meaning you had to sign that
you wouldn't share with others before you even started using them.

Seeing this trend, Stallman went against the grain and starte the GNU
Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the GPL.

GNU Text Editor - Emacs and the C compiler - GCC were successful. GNU had produced most of a free software except for the Kernal. the design that turned out to be harder to implement than expected.Finally Linus Torvalds a finish computer science student with the help of developers around the world completed a free Kernal with a more conservative design. he named it Linux.

these advents lead to the first completley free software. GNU was not the only group working on a free operating system ( NetBSD --> FreeBSD)


# Berkeley Software Distribution

- A gradual reimplementation of the Unix operating system, practiced ideals
	of free software with flair and and enthusiasm by coordinating a
	massive distrubuted dev effort in which Unix cmd-line utilities
	and code libraries and eventually the kernal itself  were re-written
	from scratchby mostly colunteers.
- the BSD project was an early example of non-idological free software dev 
	and served as a training ground form many devs who remained active
	the open source world

- X Window system = a free network-transparent graphical computing
	environment developed by MIT in the mid 1980s with hardware vendors
	The X License deliberately allowed proprietary extensions on top of
	the free core. each member had the opertunity to advance the default
	distribution. X Windows was free, but worked as a means of leveling
	the playing field between competing businesses and standardized 
	coding practices
- TeX by Donald Knuth's free, publishing- quality typesetting system. anyone
	could modify or distribute the code, but could not call it TeX 
	unless it passed a very strict set of compatibility tests.
